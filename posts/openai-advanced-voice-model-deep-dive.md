In this post, we're going to explore OpenAI's new **Advanced Voice Mode (AVM)**, focusing on its capabilities, limitations, and how it performs in **Somali language** based on our tests. I teamed up with **Muhammad** ([@muhaksim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhaksim/)) to put this new mode through its paces, and we came away with some interesting findings!

## What is OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode?

OpenAI's Advanced Voice Mode is a newly launched feature in ChatGPT designed to enhance the conversational experience through more natural and interactive voice communication. It's part of the latest innovations in natural language processing, designed to recognize and produce speech across multiple languages.

### Key Aspects of AVM:

- **Launch and Availability**: Rolled out to ChatGPT Plus and Teams subscribers on September 24, 2024. Plans to extend to Enterprise and Edu customers soon, but currently unavailable in several regions, including the EU and UK.
- **New Interface**: Features a blue animated sphere instead of the previous black dots, making interactions more engaging.
- **Voice Options**: Introduces five new voices (Arbor, Maple, Sol, Spruce, and Vale), bringing the total to nine.
- **Technology**: Built on GPT-4's audio capabilities, allowing for real-time conversations that can pick up on non-verbal cues.
