In this post, we’re going to explore OpenAI’s new **advanced voice mode**, focusing on its capabilities, limitations, and how it performs in **Somali language** based on our tests. I teamed up with **Muhammad**([@muhaksim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhaksim/)) to put this new mode through its paces, and we came away with some interesting findings!

## What is the OpenAI Advanced Voice mode?

OpenAI’s advanced voice mode is part of the latest innovations in natural language processing, designed to recognize and produce speech across multiple languages. The mode has a wide range of potential applications, including:

- **Multilingual voice recognition**: Seamlessly recognizes and switches between multiple languages.
- **Text-to-speech and speech-to-text**: Capable of generating high-quality, natural-sounding speech in real-time.
- **Interactive learning**: Adapts to specific pronunciations and learning patterns.

## Key Features of the mode

Here are some standout features of OpenAI's new voice mode:

- **Multilingual support**: One of the most impressive aspects is the mode’s ability to switch effortlessly between languages like **English** and **Somali**, making it highly versatile.
- **Real-time adaptation**: During our tests, we noticed the mode can learn on the fly, adjusting pronunciations and improving based on feedback during a conversation.
- **Natural voice synthesis**: The mode generates natural-sounding speech that can be fine-tuned for various accents and languages.

## Our Test: Performance in Somali

### 🌟 **What We Liked**

1. **Effortless Language Switching**: The mode moves smoothly between Somali and English, making it perfect for bilingual or multilingual users.
   
2. **Learning Capability**: We tested the mode by teaching it how to pronounce certain Somali letters like “C.” Surprisingly, it adapted quickly within the chat itself, showing real-time learning potential.

3. **Text Generation**: The GPT-4-powered text generation in **Somali** was **excellent**. The fluency and coherence stood out, creating a smooth interaction.

### 🚩 **Areas for Improvement**

1. **Transcription Accuracy**: The transcription was inconsistent at times, especially when generating random characters or words that didn’t match what was spoken. This issue occurred in both Somali and English, and I hope future updates will address this.
   
2. **Pronunciation Challenges**:
   - **The letter "X"**: In Somali, the letter "X" is pronounced like “ha' ” but the AI mispronounced it consistently.
   - **The letter "C"**: This letter, which sounds close to "a' " was also not pronounced accurately.

## Improvements We Hope to See

While the mode is quite powerful, there's always room for improvement. Here are a few areas where we believe it could get better:

- **Transcription Accuracy**: Enhancing the transcription system, especially for non-Western languages like Somali, would make a significant difference.
- **Pronunciation of Complex Letters**: Adjusting how it handles phonetic nuances specific to languages like Somali would elevate its usability.
- **Interactive Learning Over Multiple Sessions**: Although it learns within the chat session, it would be amazing if the learning could persist across multiple sessions for a more personalized experience.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, I’m impressed with the advancements made by OpenAI’s voice mode, especially its **multilingual support** and **real-time adaptation**. While there are some issues with transcription and pronunciation in Somali, the progress so far is exciting.

I’m confident that future iterations of it will address these concerns, making it even more robust for languages like Somali.
