# Growth, Resilience, and New Beginnings  

2024 was a year that pushed me to my limits, both personally and professionally. It wasnâ€™t a smooth rideâ€”it was a year filled with ambitious projects, hard decisions, tough lessons, and valuable growth. Despite the challenges, it became a defining year of transformation, setting the foundation for an exciting future.

## The Year Began with Bold Goals  

At the start of 2024, I was focused on building solutions that made an impact. One of the projects closest to my heart was **InterviewWay**, a startup idea aimed at helping individuals prepare for interviews and assessments. While the idea showed promise, I decided to put it on hold to focus on other pressing opportunities.

## Headstarter: A Season of Intense Learning  

Midway through the year, I joined the **Headstarter program**, a seven-week sprint that stretched my creativity and technical skills. During this time, I built impactful projects, including:  

- **Flashcard SaaS**: A platform leveraging OpenAI and Stripe to make learning seamless and effective.  
- **InternSim**: A groundbreaking simulation tool for aspiring developers to gain hands-on experience through AI-powered projects.  
- **Scraper**: A data extraction tool designed for efficiency and practicality.  

These projects were not startups but exercises in rapid prototyping and problem-solving, teaching me the value of quick execution and collaboration.

## Relocating for Growth and Security  

One of the most significant decisions I made this year was moving from **Somalia** to **Kenya**. The decision was fueled by security concerns and the need for a stable environment to focus on my work. The move was challenging, bringing with it moments of doubt and difficulty, but it was a necessary step toward a brighter future.

## Facing Adversity and Personal Growth  

2024 wasnâ€™t without its share of challenges. I faced numerous negative situations, from professional setbacks to personal struggles. At some point in the year, I was dealing with **imposter syndrome** a feeling that I wasnâ€™t qualified for the expectations people had of me in terms of tech. This inner battle made me question my abilities and whether I truly deserved the recognition I was receiving.  

One of the biggest lessons Iâ€™ve learned is that **living by other peopleâ€™s expectations will never bring peace**. Trying to meet everyone elseâ€™s standards only deepened my insecurities. Overcoming this required a shift in perspective:  

- **Focusing on my own growth** and recognizing my achievements for what they are.  
- Accepting that I donâ€™t have to meet anyoneâ€™s expectations but my own.  
- Understanding that itâ€™s okay to feel unsure at times, as long as I keep learning and improving.  

These lessons became the foundation for reclaiming my confidence and inner peace.

## A Major Shift: Starting Over  

As the year came to a close, I had a moment of clarity after watching a **Starter Story video** that challenged me to rethink my approach. I decided to **close all my previous projects** and start over with a clean slate.  

This reset marked the beginning of **Lama Tools**, an AI tools development agency with a mission to create practical, cutting-edge solutions. The shift wasnâ€™t just about starting a new projectâ€”it was about building a future aligned with my values and long-term goals. It symbolized a fresh chapter, fueled by the lessons and growth from the past year.

## Looking Forward: My Vision for 2025  

As I step into 2025, Iâ€™m driven by a clear set of goals that reflect the lessons learned this year:  

1. **Learning to Say "No"**: Setting boundaries and focusing on what truly matters.  
2. **Financial Discipline**: Avoiding unnecessary spending and investing in meaningful growth.  
3. **Mastering AI Agentics**: Diving deep into multi-agent systems and their applications.  
4. **Scaling Lama Tools**: Working to reach or get closer to $10K MRR and establishing Lama Tools as a go-to agency for AI-powered solutions.  
5. **Living on My Own Terms**: Letting go of othersâ€™ expectations and finding peace in pursuing what I truly value.  
6. **Starting Content Creation**: Sharing my journey, lessons, and technical expertise through platforms like YouTube and blogs to inspire and connect with a wider audience.

## A Year of Growth and Purpose (Conclusion )

2024 was a year of growth, filled with highs and lows. It was a year where I learned to adapt, to let go of what wasnâ€™t serving me, and to embrace new opportunities. The lessons Iâ€™ve learnedâ€”especially the importance of living on my own termsâ€”will guide me as I continue this journey.  

As I look forward to 2025, Iâ€™m excited to build on this foundation, turning challenges into achievements and dreams into reality.
