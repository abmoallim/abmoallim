## About Me

Hello! I'm Abdihamid Moallim, a Fullstack Developer passionate about web technologies and AI. With a background in software engineering, I've developed a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. My journey started with a curiosity for coding, and it has since evolved into a dedicated career in software development.

I thrive on creating meaningful web experiences that solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest trends in technology, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the community. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
